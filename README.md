# sleepstorm's python mini-projects archive
*My python mini-projects archive.*

A while back, I made a bunch of mini-projects in python and I had separate repositories for them so I decided I would put them all in one repo and you could access the python files. As of the time of writing you aren't able to execute them but I will hope to add that in as a feature soon.
